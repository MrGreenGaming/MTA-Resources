update v0.1.2:
-Changed the water texture (back to png)
-Changed drawing method

This resource is a modified water shader from shader examples.
It applies a light sky colors to get a pseudo-sky-reflection.
The outcome looks better then expected. The effect also creates a 
light sun specular on the water surface. The position of the highlight 
changes during the night and day. I also have changed the normal 
and cube texture to make the waves look nicer.
