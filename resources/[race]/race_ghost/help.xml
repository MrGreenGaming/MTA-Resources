<help>Race Ghost records and plays back your runs so you can have a visual comparison of how you&apos;re doing. This version has been edited by LotsOfS to save PB (personal best) ghosts in additon to WR (world record / top) ghosts, by Discoordination to be able to customise the number of extra (other people&apos;s PBs) ghosts you see, and by Lordmau5 to use JSON format instead of XML.

To use, enter /ghosts followed by a number. These numbers aren&apos;t meaningless setting IDs, they actually mean how many ghosts will load. If there is no top ghost but there is a PB ghost, it will load the PB ghost.

0 - Disabled
1 - Only top ghost
2 - Only top and PB ghosts
3 - Top, PB, and 1 extra ghosts
...
12 - Top, PB, and 10 extra ghosts

Ghosts longer than 10 minutes aren&apos;t saved by default, but the maximum length may be increased or decreased by server admins.

Ghosts of your PBs are stored locally on your own machine. This will lessen the load on the server and speed up map transition times when a lot of players are present.
If you&apos;re worried about disk space, ghosts are stored in &quot;&lt;Multi Theft Auto Installation Directory&gt;\mods\deathmatch\priv\&lt;Server ID&gt;\race_ghost\ghosts&quot; and their file size is about 1 KB (kilobyte) per second of recording, or 1 MB (megabyte) per 17 minutes.
If no local copy is found (eg. after a reformat), it will fetch a backup ghost from the server and store that on the local machine for future use.
To get a server&apos;s ID, please ask the server owner. There is no easy way to view it for a server, so they need to check the private key file (server-id.keys).
