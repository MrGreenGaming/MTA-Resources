# Mr.Green-MTA-Resources
All resources used on the MrGreenGaming.com Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas (MTASA) servers (Race &amp; Race Mix).

# Goal
TBA

# Setting up a local server
- Checkout the resources into your local MTA server folder
- You can use the Mr.Green-MTA-Resources/config/mtaserver.conf file to use as an example server config
- A lot of resources need access to MySQL and GC accounts to work:
  1. Older resources still need their SQL tables created before they can run, use the dumps Mr.Green-MTA-Resources/config/green_coins.sql and Mr.Green-MTA-Resources/config/mrgreen_mtasrvs.sql to create them
  2. Set up the connection to your MySQL server in the gcshop settings (with runcode for example): `/srun set("*gcshop.host", 'localhost'); set("*gcshop.dbname", 'mrgreen_mtasrvs'); set("*gcshop.user", 'root'); set("*gcshop.pass", '');`
  3. Set up gc devmode, this skips the need to check passwords with /gclogin: `/srun set("*gc.devmode", true)`
    * Now you can login with `/gclogin <forumid> admin`, the forumid is the id for an account you can choose
