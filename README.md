# Mr.Green-MTA-Resources
All resources used on the MrGreenGaming.com Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas (MTASA) servers (Race &amp; Race Mix).

# Setting up a local server
- Checkout the resources into your local MTA server folder.
- Example maps, server config file, ACL example and SQL tables can be found in the `config` folder.
- A lot of resources need access to a MySQL server and/or to GC accounts to work:

  1. Setup gc devmode, with this you can gclogin with a testing account: `/srun set("*gc.devmode", true)`
    * Restart the MTA server. Now you can login with `/gclogin <forumid> admin` or using F6, just pick a forumid as any random number. 
    You will start with 99999 GC. Important to use a number as login and 'admin' as the password.
  2. Setup a MySQL server (you'll need its host adress, username and a password optionally)
    * The web development packet WAMP (or XAMPP) has a mysql server and phpmyadmin builtin, you can download it and install from here http://www.wampserver.com/
    * phpmyadmin is a very handy tool to help with configuring and importing data, learn how to use it
  3. Older script resources need their tables created before they can do anything, import `config/mrgreen_mtasrvs.sql` with PHPMYADMIN .
  4. Now back into MTA. Set up the connection to your MySQL server in the gcshop settings (with runcode for example): `/srun set("*gcshop.host", 'localhost'); set("*gcshop.dbname", 'mrgreen_mtasrvs'); set("*gcshop.user", 'root'); set("*gcshop.pass", '');`
  5. Restart the MTA server to make sure everything works correctly
