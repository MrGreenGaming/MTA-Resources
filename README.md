# Mr.Green-MTA-Resources
All resources used on the MrGreenGaming.com Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas (MTASA) servers (Race &amp; Race Mix).

# Local server setup
- Checkout the resources into your local MTASA server folder.
- Example maps, server config file and an ACL example can be found in the `config` folder.
- Setup GreenCoins development mode, with this you can `gclogin` with a testing account. Run this command on an admin client: `/srun set("*gc.devmode", true)`
- Restart the MTA server. Now you can login with `/gclogin <forumid> admin` or using F6, just pick a forumid as any random number. You will start with 99999 GC. Important to use a number as login and 'admin' as the password.
- Setup a MySQL database and import `config/database.sql`.
- Connect to your MySQL database in the gcshop settings (with runcode for example): `/srun set("*gcshop.host", 'localhost'); set("*gcshop.dbname", 'mrgreen_mtasrvs'); set("*gcshop.user", 'root'); set("*gcshop.pass", '');`
- Restart MTA server for the last time.
